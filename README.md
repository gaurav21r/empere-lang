# Extraction & Mapping of Patterns in English like Regular Expressions

A new, simple, high level, open programming language for Pattern Matching & Text Extraction. *Easier than Regular Expressions*

**Under Construction**

## Introduction

What started as an [esoteric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language), actually has a great use case!

 - EMPERE is used to select, extract, match or test text based on patterns. It is an easier, more readable alternative to Regular Expressions.
 - EMPERE compiles to RegExes and is inter operable with them in a variety of environments.
 - EMPERE has a very verbose, almost english style of language constructs.
 - EMPERE works best when used in teams. It becomes really easy to understand each other's ARORA code rather than Regular Expression Code.
 - EMPERE started as a hobby project to investigate Grammars and how Regular Expressions can be improved has turned out to be surprisingly useful.
 - EMPERE is still under heavy development and Language Features are subject to change.
 - EMPERE currently supports only JavaScript Regular expressions without Grouping & Capturing. We hope to support all languages and all use cases of pattern matching with active contributions from the community.
 - An online compiler for EMPERE is underway and will be released very soon.


## Language Features

### 1. Data Types

#### 1.1. Strings

1.1.1. Strings are alphanumeric characters between double `"` quotes. Special symbols are also allowed.
Eg: "abc", "Ab!$%K"


#### 1.2. Operators

1.2.1. Operators are like functions.

```empere
Any Of ("abc") -> [abc]
```

1.2.2. They accept zero or more (1, 2, 3) arguments. 
1.2.3. They resemble english and can have whitespaces between.
1.2.4. They use {{sentence}} case.
1.2.5. They can have any number of operators inside them.

#### 1.3. User Defined Operators

1.3.1. Users can create their own operators.
1.3.2. They can have one or more arguments like inbuilt Operators.

### 2. Statements

2.1. Statements are Operators separated by a comma `,`.
2.2. Statements are optionally ended with a semicolon `;` though it is highly recommended to do so.
2.3. *Coming Soon*

### 3. Output
